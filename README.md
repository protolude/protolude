A sensible starting Prelude for building custom Preludes.

Design points:

* Banishes String.
* Banishes partial functions.
* Compiler warning on bottoms.
* Polymorphic string IO functions.
* Polymorphic show.
* Automatic string conversions.
* Types for common data structures in scope.
* Types for all common string types (Text/ByteString) in scope.
* Banishes impure exception throwing outside of IO.
* StateT/ReaderT/ExceptT transformers in scope by default.
* Foldable / Traversable functions in scope by default.
* Unsafe functions are prefixed with "unsafe" in separate module.
* Compiler agnostic, GHC internal modules are abstracted out into Base.
* ``sum`` and ``product`` are strict by default.
* Compatibility with GHC 8.0.
* Includes Semiring for GHC >= 7.6.
* Includes Bifunctor for GHC >= 7.6.
* Includes Semigroup for GHC >= 7.6.

Supports:

 * GHC 7.6.1
 * GHC 7.6.2
 * GHC 7.6.3
 * GHC 7.8.1
 * GHC 7.8.2
 * GHC 7.8.3
 * GHC 7.8.4
 * GHC 7.10.1
 * GHC 7.10.2
 * GHC 7.10.3
 * GHC 8.0.1
 * GHC 8.0.2
 * GHC 8.2.1
 * GHC 8.4.1
 * GHC 8.6.1
 * GHC 8.8.1

Usage
-----

To try out standalone prelude at the interactive shell, from the Protolude
project directory run.

```haskell
$ stack exec ghci
> import Protolude
```

Swapping out the old Prelude
----------------------------

Disable the built-in prelude at the top of your file:

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE NoImplicitPrelude #-}
```

Or directly in your project cabal file:

```haskell
default-extensions: NoImplicitPrelude
```

Then in your modules:

```haskell
import Protolude
```

Exported Functions
------------------

The list of exports can be browsed [here](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/protolude-0.2.3/docs/Protolude.html).

Dependencies
------------

Protolude tries to be light on dependencies and only pulls in *essential*
libraries that are universally common across most real-world projects. Lower and
upper bounds are fully specified and compatible with both vanilla Cabal and
tracks Stack LTS resolver.

| Dependencies        | Lower (>=) | Upper (<) |
| -----------         |   -------- |  -------- |
| array               |        0.4 |       0.6 |
| async               |        2.0 |       2.3 |
| base                |        4.6 |      4.13 |
| bytestring          |       0.10 |      0.11 |
| containers          |        0.5 |       0.7 |
| deepseq             |        1.3 |       1.5 |
| ghc-prim            |        0.3 |       0.6 |
| hashable            |        1.2 |       1.3 |
| mtl                 |        2.1 |       2.3 |
| stm                 |        2.4 |       2.6 |
| text                |        1.2 |       1.3 |
| transformers        |        0.4 |       0.6 |
|                     |            |           |

Structure
---------

Protolude's main modules are the following:

* [Protolude.hs](https://github.com/sdiehl/protolude/blob/master/src/Protolude.hs)
* [Base.hs](https://github.com/sdiehl/protolude/blob/master/src/Protolude/Base.hs)
* [Show.hs](https://github.com/sdiehl/protolude/blob/master/src/Protolude/Show.hs)
* [Conv.hs](https://github.com/sdiehl/protolude/blob/master/src/Protolude/Conv.hs)

FAQs
----

* **My ``putStrLn`` and ``putStr`` instances are no longer inferred in the presense
of the ``-XOverloadedStrings`` extension?**

Because the print functions are polymorphic the type of the print functions may
require annotations if the type is not fully specified by inference. To force a
specific type at the call site use either 

```haskell
putText :: MonadIO m => T.Text -> m ()
putLText :: MonadIO m => TL.Text -> m ()
```

* **How do I write manual Show instances if ``show`` isn't provided?**

Generally speaking writing manual instances of Show is a [Haskell antipattern](
http://www.stephendiehl.com/posts/strings.html) because it produces
law-violating instances of Show. You probably want to use a [pretty
printer](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/wl-pprint-text) library for custom
printing.

If backwards compatibility is needed then the base library can be imported
manually.

```haskell
import GHC.Show (Show(..))
```

Automatic deriving of ``Show`` for your types is still supported since the class
is in scope by default.

* **Partial functions like ``undefined`` raise compiler warnings on
  usage.**

This is by design. For fatal uncatchable errors use the provided ``panic``
function if you intend the program to immediately abort.

```haskell
panic "Thus I die. Thus, thus, thus. Now I am dead"
```

If inside of IO simply use ``throwIO`` for exception handling, or if in pure
business logic use well-typed checked exceptions of the ``ExceptT`` variety.

* **Why is ``id`` not in scope?**

It has been renamed to ``identity`` to reserve the ``id`` identifier for the
more common use case of business logic.
